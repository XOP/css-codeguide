CSS Codeguide
=============

> Documentation for coding and maintaining the most transparent CSS.
> It is bringing the experience of multiple front-end teams.

Current code guide is designed for **experienced developers** in the first place, but hopefully could be a great source of knowledge for the beginners.

Basically this documentation is about how to work in team with 250+ style files and feel comfortable about that.

Please be aware, that CSS fundamentals, selector performance or other common topics are not the part of this guide.
On the other hand there will be reviewed different aspects of CSS described with practical examples, recommendations and best practicies.

> All along the text there will be links to examples folder.
> In most cases it is invaluable for understanding the picture in total,
> so check it out before further reading and keep them opened just in case.

Let's get started!
