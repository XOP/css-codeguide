CSS Codeguide
=============

> Documentation for coding and maintaining the most transparent CSS.
> This code guide was found at the [ok](http://ok.ru) front-end team.

Current code guide is designed for experienced developers in the first place, but hopefully could be a great source of knowledge for the beginners.

It doesn't cover topics on CSS fundamentals, selector performance or methodologies. It is basically how to work in team with 250+ style files and feel comfortable about that.

In case you are new to CSS, please check following links, getting yourself prepared.

**todo: links**

> Check out __samples__ folder for real-life examples and deeper syntax understanding.
