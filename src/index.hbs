CSS Codeguide
=============

> Documentation for coding and maintaining the most transparent CSS.
> This style guide was born at the [ok](http://ok.ru) front-end team.

Current style guide is designed for advanced users, but still might be very useful for the beginners.
We don't cover how to write pure css or selector performance here. If you need this information we advise to look at [css guide lines](http://cssguidelin.es/) and then back to compare different approaches to decide which one works better for you.
The point of this guide is to show how to live with more than 250 style files and feel comfortable with that.
We gonna try to be not too boring, so be ready to surf through examples and best practices.

Well, here we are!
