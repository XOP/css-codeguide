CSS Codeguide
=============

> Documentation for coding and maintaining the most transparent CSS.
> It is bringing the experience of multiple front-end teams.

Current code guide is designed for experienced developers in the first place, but hopefully could be a great source of knowledge for the beginners.

It **doesn't cover topics on CSS fundamentals, selector performance or methodologies**. On the other hand it touches different aspects of CSS and provides recommendation on best practicies.

Basically this documentation is about how to work in team with 250+ style files and feel comfortable about that.

> All along the text there will be links to examples folder.
> In most cases it is invaluable for understanding the picture in total,
> so check it out before further reading and keep opened just in case.

Let's get started!
