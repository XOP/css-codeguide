## Methodology

In a nutshell, CSS methodology prescribes how CSS should be written, therefore defining the scalability, maintainability and architecture in total.  
In fact, architecture is often named methodology and vice versa.

It also important to mention that this all does not make any sense if in the end results in productivity deterioration. Consider architecture in terms of convenience and development speed as well.

There is quiet a number of methodologies to choose from:
- [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/)
- [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/)
- [Atomic CSS](http://acss.io/)
- [Suit CSS](http://suitcss.github.io/)
- [MCSS](http://operatino.github.io/MCSS/en/)

Some of them just provide rules and instructions, others propose the whole workflow to acquire.  
Feel free to investigate what suits your needs best!

Current guide takes advantage of common [BEM principles](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) and also has few traits from [Suit CSS](http://suitcss.github.io/).
