## Methodology

In a nutshell, CSS methodology prescribes how CSS should be written, therefore defining the scalability, maintainability and architecture in total.  
In fact, architecture is often named methodology and vice versa.

There is quiet a number of methodologies to choose from:
- [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/)
- [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/)
- [Atomic CSS](http://acss.io/)
- [Suit CSS](http://suitcss.github.io/)
- [MCSS](http://operatino.github.io/MCSS/en/)

Some of them just provide rules and instructions, others propose the whole workflow to consider.  
Feel free to investigate what suits your needs best!

Current guide takes advantage of common [BEM principles](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) and also has few traits from [Suit CSS](http://suitcss.github.io/).
