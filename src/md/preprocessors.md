## Syntax using preprocessors

No matter what preprocessor you are using. The point is to decide which functionality you use with these preprocessors.
Here is the list what features of preprocessors we are using:

* Variables
* Nesting (with limitations)
* Mixins
* Code blocks
* Loops (with restrictions)

### Common rules

Whilst you can drop out brackets from declaration using stylus, we recommend not to do that.
Separate nesting rules with a whitespace.

```scss
/* bad */
.class
    display block
    color red
    &:hover {
        color: #000;
        }

/* good */
.class {
    display: block;
    color: red;

    &:hover {
        color: #000;
        }
    }
```

The rule here is to write your code as plain css.

### Nesting

Avoid using unnecessary nesting and deeper than **3** levels. We use nesting only for:

* Pseudo elements
* Context classes
* Refactoring/redesign issues

All other cases rely on MCSS. One more thing we want to mention is never use composite class names using nesting.
It makes impossible to find classes in your project.

```scss
/* awful */
.module {
    ...

    &_block {}
}

/* bad */
.module {
    ...

    .module_block {}
    }

.module:after {
    ...
    }

.module_block:hover {
    ...
    }

/* good */
.module {
    ...

    &:after {
        ...
        }
    }

    .module_block {
        &:hover {
            ...
            }
        }
```

Do not use `&` as a child in nesting except context classes.

```scss
/* bad */
.block {
    .module & {
        ...
        }
    }

/* good */
.block {
    .ie9 & {
        ...
        }
    }
```

Sometimes you make refactoring/redesign of some code. Common practice for that is to use modificators, such as `__v2` or `__redesign`.
In this way you can use nesting for all selectors inside. Also it is possible to use `&` before selectors to show this is nesting.
Just choose your own way and follow it everywhere.
*Note: We are not using `&`.*

```scss
/* good */
.block.__v2 {
    // ...
    // very long code, we don't see parent on the screen

    .module {
        ...
        }

    // ...
    }

/* good */
.block.__v2 {
    // ...
    // very long code, we don't see parent on the screen

    & .module {
        ...
        }

    // ...
    }
```

Do not use structural comments inside nesting. If you want to do that - check out your logic, something wrong with it.

```scss
/* bad */
.block {
    /* Module
    -------------------------------------------------- */
    .module {
        ...
        }
    /* /Module
    -------------------------------------------------- */
    }

/* good */
/* Module
-------------------------------------------------- */
.block {

    .module {
        ...
        }

    }
/* /Module
-------------------------------------------------- */
```

### Variables naming

### Mixins

todo

When you use mixins - write them first in a ruleset.


### Extends

> Only use extends when the rulesets that you are trying to DRY out are inherently and thematically related.
> Do not force relationships that do not exist: to do so will create unusual groupings in your project, as well as negatively impacting the source order of your code.
