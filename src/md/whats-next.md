## What's next?

Congrats, you did it, great job!

I hope you did some notes along the reading or even implemented some best-practices described here. If not - here's a nice starting list of what you can start or proceed with:

- Analyze your (your team) needs. Through the flaws and error-prone areas in your code get the list of what has to be improved in the first place.
- Remember your product needs and environment specifics! You most probably will not need _all_ techniques and features from this document.
- Start with module approach. Break your code into smaller chunks until it feels right and comfortable.
- Consider methodology (BEM or BEM-specific of your choice) your companion on this not-so-light path.
- Choose the preprocessor. SCSS is the main recommendation.
- Establish a set of mixins that your modules can share.
- Incorporate tools for linting your CSS. Generally it takes some time to make it look fit for the first time. But later on it goes smoothly!

And the last, but simply the **most important thing**, that defines the success:

> Common code should look like it has been written by one person.
