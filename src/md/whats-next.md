## What's next?

Congrats, you did it, great job!

I hope you made some notes along the reading or even implemented some best-practice techniques described here. If not - here's a nice starting list of what you can proceed with:

- Analyze your (your team) needs. Through the flaws and error-prone areas in your code get the list of what has to be improved in the first place.
- Start with module approach. Break your code into smaller chunks until it feels right and comfortable.
- Consider methodology (BEM or BEM-specific of your choice) your companion on this not-so-light path.
- Choose the preprocessor. SCSS is the main recommendation.
- Establish a set of mixins that your modules can share.
- Incorporate tools for linting your CSS. Generally it takes some time to make it look fit for the first time. But later on it goes smoothly!

And the last, but simply the **most important thing**, that defines the success:

> Common code should look like it has been written by one person.
