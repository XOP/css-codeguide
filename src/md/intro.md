## Intro


### Why another Guide

There is quiet a number of style/code- guides already, that can be divided into:

**General guides**

- [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
- [CSS {guide: lines;}](https://cssguidelin.es)
- [SUIT CSS (codestyle only)](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/STYLE.md)
- [SASS guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es)

Address the large audience, covering all (sometimes almost encyclopedic) aspects.  
Great for insight and common knowledge, but less practical.

**Company|Team-specific guides**

- [ThinkUp](https://github.com/ThinkUpLLC/ThinkUp/wiki/Code-Style-Guide:-CSS)
- [Wordpress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/css/)
- [Trello](https://gist.github.com/bobbygrace/9e961e8982f42eb91b80)
- [Github Primer](http://primercss.io/guidelines/#scss)

Much more specific instructions and recommendations, from the companies or individuals sharing experience with the community.  
Practical for sure and make more sense if you work there.

So, why not just use one of them?  
Not taking it any further, this current guide focuses on the subject, leaving aside general issues.  
At the same time it contains methodology-specific features, [BEM](https://en.bem.info/), in particular.  
The core of it is brevity and common practical experience.

But anyhow, it would be a great thing to at least take a look at other examples before proceeding!


### About

Couple welcome words about code guide specifics to take the most from using it:

1\. Documentation is written with regards on using CSS preprocessor. 
As the most popular and widespread one, **[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS syntax)** is used for illustrating purposes.  
Please notice, that common conceptions are also valid for **vanilla CSS** in the first place.

If you are not into preprocessors yet, check out the following popular tools you will most certainly find useful:

- [SASS/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
- [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
- [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)

2\. Current code guide is the result of several front-end teams experience, so it might have project-specific and environment assumptions. To make it more friendly there will be plenty of useful links to cover blank spots and useful tips on some topics.

Here's the legend:

:zap: - warning or attention required  
:page_with_curl: - code follow-up

3\. "I'm reading and yet can not understand a thing!". Well I've been there too. Let's have a talk about it. Waiting for [your questions](https://github.com/XOP/css-codeguide/issues)!
