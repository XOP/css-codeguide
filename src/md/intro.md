1. No matter if you are using css preprocessors or not. I mean it is much better if you are, but all information below might be apply to pure css also.
We are using stylus and all examples here is wrote down with stylus syntax.
2. This style guide is the result of our experience and was built under our eco system. However we provide a lot of links here to learn deeper different stuff.
3. Feel free to fork it, make edits and use it inside your project.
4. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please open an issue.
