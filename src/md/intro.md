## Intro

Couple welcome words about code guide specifics to take the most from using it:

1. Documentation provided is written with regards on using CSS preprocessor. 
As the most popular and widespread one SCSS is used in documentation.  
Please notice, that common conceptions are valid for vanilla CSS in the first place.

If you are not into preprocessors yet, check out the following popular tools you will most certainly find useful: [SASS/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss).

2. Current code guide is the result of the front-end team experience, so it might have project-specific and environment assumptions. To make it more friendly we provide useful links to cover blank spots and perhaps introduce useful tips on some topics.

3. Feel free to fork it, edit and use inside your project. We will be happy to get feedback and know how it resolves your team issues, please do not hesitate to contact us!

4. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please open an issue.
