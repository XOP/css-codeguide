## Intro


### Why another Guide

There is quiet a number of style/code- guides already, that can be divided into:

**General guides**

- [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
- [CSS {guide: lines;}](https://cssguidelin.es)
- [SUIT CSS (codestyle only)](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/STYLE.md)
- [SASS guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es)

Address the large audience, covering all (sometimes almost encyclopedic) aspects.  
Great for insight and common knowledge, but less practical.

**Company|Team-specific guides**

- [ThinkUp](https://github.com/ThinkUpLLC/ThinkUp/wiki/Code-Style-Guide:-CSS)
- [Wordpress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/css/)
- [Trello](https://gist.github.com/bobbygrace/9e961e8982f42eb91b80)
- [Github Primer](http://primercss.io/guidelines/#scss)

Much more specific instructions and recommendations, from the companies or individuals sharing experience with the community.  
Practical for sure and make more sense if you work there.

So, why not just use one of them?  
Not taking it any further, this current guide focuses on the subject, leaving aside general issues.  
At the same time it contains methodology-specific features, [BEM](https://en.bem.info/), in particular.  
The core of it is brevity and common practical experience.

But anyhow, it would be a great thing to at least take a look at other examples before proceeding!


### About
